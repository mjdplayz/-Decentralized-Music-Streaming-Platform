# üéµ Decentralized Music Streaming Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Music Streaming Platform is a blockchain-based solution that revolutionizes how music is distributed, streamed, and monetized. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform eliminates intermediaries between artists and listeners, ensuring fair compensation and transparent revenue distribution.

Artists can upload their music tracks to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and set their own streaming prices, while listeners pay directly to stream music. The platform automatically handles payment distribution, taking only a small platform fee while ensuring artists receive the majority of streaming revenue instantly.

## Project Vision

**"Empowering artists with direct ownership and fair monetization of their creative work while providing listeners with transparent, affordable access to quality music."**

Our vision is to create a truly decentralized music ecosystem where:
- Artists maintain complete control over their intellectual property
- Revenue distribution is transparent and immediate
- Listeners directly support their favorite artists
- No centralized authority controls content or pricing
- Global accessibility without geographical restrictions
- Fair compensation based on actual consumption
